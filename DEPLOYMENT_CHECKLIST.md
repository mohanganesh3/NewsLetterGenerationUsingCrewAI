# 🚀 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Render, make sure you complete these steps:

## ✅ Code Preparation

- [x] ✅ Fixed Groq model deprecation (now using Google Gemini)
- [x] ✅ Updated crew.py to use simplified approach
- [x] ✅ Created clean app.py without import issues
- [x] ✅ Added start.sh script for proper Streamlit configuration
- [x] ✅ Updated render.yaml with correct startup command

## ✅ Files Ready for Deployment

- [x] ✅ `render.yaml` - Render service configuration
- [x] ✅ `pyproject.toml` - Python dependencies
- [x] ✅ `poetry.lock` - Locked dependency versions
- [x] ✅ `start.sh` - Startup script for Render
- [x] ✅ `src/gui/app.py` - Main Streamlit application
- [x] ✅ `src/newsletter_gen/crew.py` - Fixed crew implementation
- [x] ✅ `.gitignore` - Excludes .env and sensitive files

## ✅ Environment Variables Needed

You'll need to set these in Render dashboard:

1. **EXA_API_KEY**: `67c8e473-3062-48e1-810e-ab2987b6137a`
2. **GOOGLE_API_KEY**: `AIzaSyDJhsySR_JqrVNns8dbY7vZVUNK-4EEVL0`

## ✅ Quick Local Test

Run this to make sure everything works locally:

```bash
# Test the app locally
poetry install
poetry run streamlit run src/gui/app.py

# Test the startup script
./start.sh
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Never commit API keys** - They should only be set as environment variables in Render
2. **The .env file is ignored** - This is correct for security
3. **Use the startup script** - It includes proper Streamlit configuration for Render
4. **Python version** - Make sure it's compatible (3.10-3.13)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render:**
   - Follow the detailed guide in `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
   - Set environment variables in Render dashboard
   - Deploy and test

## 🔧 If Deployment Fails

Check these common issues:
- Environment variables are set correctly
- Python version compatibility
- All dependencies in pyproject.toml
- Startup script permissions (chmod +x start.sh)
- Streamlit port configuration

## 🌐 Expected Result

Your app should be accessible at:
`https://newsletter-gen.onrender.com` (or your chosen service name)
